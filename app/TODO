### Architecture of the tax paralegal-pal
====================================================================================

First the user will ask a question to the paralegal.
#NOTE: not able to call tool from ag2 with gemeni, 
TODO: either switch, to other model or cry

Paralegal
    |- Orchestrator:formulate_questions
     - decies which agent to pass the question to
     - based on the question, the orchestrator will pass the question to the appropriate agent
     - currently only tax agent is to be implemented
        |- InformationRetrievalAgent: 
            - tool: search the vector store for the most relevant documents
            **later plans:**
                - something similar to perplexity
                - tool: search the web for the most relevant documents
    |- ResponseAgent: Use the InformationRetrievalAgent's response to formulate the answer
    if the answer is not found then
        - `orchestrator` will pass the question to the TaxLawyerAgent
        - TaxLawyerAgent will formulate the answer
        - ResponseAgent: will relay the answer to the user




====================================================================
